# Conway's Game of Life Challenge Activity

## Introduction
We saw in the previous tutorial about how the rules play a vital part in the Game
of Life. In this tutorial, let's take a look at how the initial life states produce
the rich patterns that emerge over time.

## Still Life Pattern
Can you find an initial state that stays **fixed** over time? âœ‹
- :paper plane: From the ``||arcade-conways:Life||`` category, modify the
``||set initial state [] ||`` to put in an initial state.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would stay fixed over time.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window to see 
the simulation in action for the progression of the future generations.
Is the initial population staying still?

## Oscillator Pattern
Can you find an initial state that **oscillates** over time? ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘†

_An oscillating pattern is one that comes back to its initial
state after a number of iterations._
- :paper plane: From the ``||arcade-conways:Life||`` category, modify the
``||set initial state [] ||`` to put in an initial state.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw an initial state that would lead to oscillations.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window to see 
the simulation in action for the progression of the future generations.
Does it come back to same state as the initial state after a number of generations?

## Spaceship Pattern
Can you find an initial state that **translates itself across the grid** over time?
- :paper plane: From the ``||life:Life||`` category, modify the
``||set initial state [] ||`` to put in an initial state.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would be able to move across
the grid over time.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window to see 
the simulation in action for the progression of the future generations.
Does it continue moving across the grid?

## Grand Finale
You've done it! You've experienced Conway's Game of Life through this simulation
and seen that it is possible to create a game from simple rules which exhibits
basic features which we expect from living things. 

When you're done playing your game, click **Done** to return to the 
main skillmap. Congrats!
