# Conway's Game of Life Challenge Activity

## Introduction
We saw in the previous tutorial about how the rules play a vital part in the Game
of Life. In this tutorial, let's take a look at how the initial life states produce
the rich patterns that emerge over time. 

[Insert GIF for cool pattern]

## Still Life Pattern
Can you find an initial state that stays **fixed** over time? âœ‹
- :paper plane: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, grab a
``||set background image to [ ] ||`` and drag it onto the workspace.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would stay fixed over time.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window and press on **A** to start up 
the simulation to see the future generations. Is the initial population staying still?

## Oscillator Pattern
Can you find an initial state that **oscillates** over time? ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘†

_An oscillating pattern is one that comes back to its initial
state after a number of iterations._
- :paper plane: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, grab a
``||set background image to [ ] ||`` and drag it onto the workspace.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would oscillate.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window and press on **A** to start up 
the simulation to see the future generations. Does it come back to the initial
state after a number of generations?

## Spaceship Pattern
Can you find an initial state that **translates itself across the grid** over time?
- :paper plane: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, grab a
``||set background image to [ ] ||`` and drag it onto the workspace.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would be able to move across
the grid over time.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window and press on **A** to start up 
the simulation to see the future generations. Does it continue moving across the grid?

## Grand Finale
You've done it! You've experienced Conway's Game of Life through this simulation
and seen that it is possible to create a game from simple rules which exhibits
basic features which we expect from living things. 

When you're done playing your game, click **Done** to return to the
