# Game of Life Challenge Activity

## Step 1
We saw in the previous tutorial about how the rules play a vital part in the Game
of Life. In this tutorial, let's take a look at how the initial life states impact
the patterns that emerge.

## Step 2
**Still Life Pattern**:
Can you find an initial state that stays **fixed** over time?
- :paper plane: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, grab a
``||set background image to [ ] ||`` and drag it onto the workspace.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would stay fixed over time.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window and click on "A" to start up 
the simulation to see the future generations. Are they staying with the same 
cells as in the initial population?

## Step 3
**Oscillator Pattern**:
Can you find an initial state that **oscillates** over time?
- :paper plane: An oscillating pattern is one that comes back to its initial
state after a number of iterations.
- :paper plane: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, grab a
``||set background image to [ ] ||`` and drag it onto the workspace.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would oscillate.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window and click on "A" to start up 
the simulation to see the future generations. Does it come back to the initial
state after a number of generations?

## Step 4
**Spaceship Pattern**:
Can you find an initial state that **translates itself across the grid** over time?
- :paper plane: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, grab a
``||set background image to [ ] ||`` and drag it onto the workspace.
- :paper plane: Use the editor to draw a pattern that would be able to move across
the grid over time.
- :paper plane: Now, go over to the game window and click on "A" to start up 
the simulation to see the future generations. Does it continue moving across the grid?
