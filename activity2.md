# Game of Life

## Introduction ðŸ§¬

We saw in the previous tutorial that three rules were needed to 
build a simulation of life which features self-replication, 
communication and motion, and chaotic unpredictable patterns. 

These rules all basically require looking at each cell and 
counting how many live neighbors that cell has. 

Let's begin by writing code which counts alive neighbors! 

## Counting Neighbors

There is a function in your workspace that takes the **column** 
and **row** of a cell. Write code to return the number of alive 
neighbors for this cell.

#### ~ tutorialhint 

Think about how to add up the neighbors of the cell you're at! 
Maybe this block will help:

```block
let count = 0;
if (conways.getStateInDirection(conways.Direction, 0, 0) {
    count += 1;
}
```

## Adding Rules

Now that we can count alive neighbors, we need to implement the 
three rules of Conway's Game of Life! We saw in the last tutorial 
that these rules are: 

1. Any live cell with 2 OR 3 living neighbors survives. 
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive. 
3. All other live cells die, and all other dead cells stay dead. 

We've made a function for each of these rules. Look at the 
`||conways:on generation update [x] [y]||` block to see where they are being 
called! 

## Surviving Cells 

In the `||functions:ruleOne||` function, add code to
ensure that any **currently alive cell** with 2 or 3 living 
neighbors survives to the next generation. Make sure to use 
the `||variables:neighbors||` variable!

![Living cells with two or three living neighbors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shakao/skillmap-game-of-life/master/images/rule1.gif)

The two **pink** cells above will survive to the next generation.

#### ~ tutorialhint 

```blocks
function ruleOne(col: number, row: number, neighbors: number) {
    if (conways.getState(col, row)) {
        if (neighbors == 2) {
            conways.setState(col, row, true);
        } else if (neighbors == 3) {
            conways.setState(col, row, true);
        }
    }
}
```

## New Cells

Next, add the `||functions:ruleTwo||` code so that any 
**currently dead cell** with exactly three living neighbors 
becomes alive.

![Dead cells with three living neighbors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shakao/skillmap-game-of-life/master/images/rule2.gif)

The two dead cells highlighted in **yellow** will become 
alive in the next generation.

#### ~ tutorialhint 

This code will be very similar to the code you wrote for rule one!
Check out this block as well:

```block
if (conways.getIsDead(0, 0)) { }
```

## Dying Cells âš°

Finally, add the `||functions:ruleThree||` code so that any 
**currently alive cell** with less than two or greater than 
three living neighbors dies.  

![Alive cells with one and four neighbors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shakao/skillmap-game-of-life/master/images/rule3.gif)

The two **red** cells will die in the next generation.
